{Abstract}: Abstract(#br)This paper contributes to the literature that analyses the relationship between Share-Option Based Compensation (SOBC) expense and shareholder returns. It utilises a sample of financial firms listed in the European Economic Area and Switzerland between 2005 and 2016 to make inferences about the impact of the financial crisis on the above-mentioned relationship. The paper also assesses the extent to which the relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns during the financial crisis varies with ownership concentration. We find evidence that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns is significantly more apparent during the financial crisis. This suggests that investors place more emphasis on the unrecognised intangible features of SOBC contracts during the crisis, even though their associated expenses are subject to managerial discretion and measurement errors. We also find that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns over the financial crisis is more pronounced when ownership is more concentrated. The results of our study are robust after controlling for firm size, potential investment growth opportunities, traditional banking activities and firm self-selection bias.

{Abstract}: Abstract(#br)Scant information is available on the environmental impacts of baby food. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the life cycle environmental sustainability of one of the most common baby foods consumed for breakfast – ready-made porridge – and to identify options for improvements. Two variants of the product are considered: dry and wet porridge. The latter has from 43% to 23 times higher impacts than the dry alternative, with the global warming potential (GWP) of wet porridge being 2.6 times higher. However, the results are sensitive to the assumption on energy consumption for the manufacture of wet porridge, showing that reducing the amount of energy by 30% would reduce this difference by 5%–70% across the impacts. The main hotspots for both products are the raw materials and manufacturing; packaging is also significant for the wet option. For the dry porridge, product reformulation would reduce the environmental impacts by 1%–67%, including a 34% reduction in GWP. Reducing water content of the cereal mixture in dry porridge from 80% to 50% would reduce GWP of the manufacturing process by 65% and by 9% in the whole life cycle. Using a plastic pouch instead of a glass jar would decrease most environmental impacts of wet porridge by 7%–89%. The findings of this study will be of interest to both baby food producers and consumers.

{Abstract}: 提出一种高效产生任意矢量光场的方法.通过利用两个光束偏移器分别对两个正交线偏振分量进行分束与合束,将传统激光模式转化为任意矢量光场.所产生矢量光场的偏振态和相位分布通过在相位型空间光调制器(SLM)上加载相应的相位实时调控.由于光路系统中不涉及任何衍射光学元件和振幅分光元件,光场转换效率高,仅取决于SLM的反射率,并且光路系统结构紧凑、稳定,同轴性易于调节.实验结果显示,采用反射率为79%的相位型SLM所产生的矢量光场的转换效率可达到58%.

{Abstract}: 利用电磁波传输理论,研究并推导出了电磁波斜入射时Salisbury屏后向反射率公式,使用三维网格法讨论了各个电磁参数、隔离层厚度、入射波频率等同后向反射率之间的关系.研究结果表明:在2～18GHz范围内,角度后向反射率有很大;在f=16GHz时,μr1和μr2取值的增加使得材料的磁损耗和储能能力加强,导致材料有很好的吸收效果;然而εr1和εr2取值增加时,由于表面反射效应增强,使得吸波效果下降;在2～18GHz频段内后向反射率均可达到4.5d B以上,能够满足军事和民用的要求.

{Abstract}: <正>大气层外动能拦截技术是弹道导弹防御技术研究的重难点问题.由于外层空间可以忽略气动力影响,动能拦截器通常采用真比例导引律(true proportional navigation, TPN)进行制导控制. TPN指令加速度方向垂直于当前弹目视线(line-of-sight, LOS),大小与视线转率成正比,具有结构简单、易于实现、鲁棒性好等优点. TPN的制导目的是控制视线转率使其不发散,从而使拦截器具有较小的脱靶量,以实现对目标的直接碰撞.
