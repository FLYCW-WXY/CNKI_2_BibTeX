A food safety curriculum was delivered either via an in-person workshop or by accessing the material on line from a personal computer. Food safety materials were based upon existing Food and Drug Administration food safety guidelines. University of California Extension Advisors taught the in-person food safety education and recruited participants for the on-line training. Volunteers (n = 242) who prepared food for 4-H programs, churches, service clubs, senior centers or other community activities completed either the on-line or in person workshop. Food safety knowledge was assessed via a pre- and post-survey. Both online and workshop education improved the food safety knowledge of participants and overall there was no significant difference found in the level of knowledge gained from the two formats. The findings have implications for when and how food safety can be taught. The future goal for this project is to promote “Make it Safe, Keep it Safe” as an online food safety education tool for use by Cooperative Extension and other educators.},

One of the main sources of microbial contamination in food products are industrial surfaces, which are colonized by pathogenic microorganisms capable of forming biofilms, making surfaces into reservoirs and potential sources of cross-contamination to food products. A study was conducted to determine the microbiological contamination from different microbial groups on different industrial surfaces in a meat processing plant through implementing a sensor-based sampling system, with a focus on detecting L. monocytogenes . The results obtained showed two main groups of areas with greater and lesser degrees of microbiological contamination, determined as the total aerobic counts of the microbial group with the highest contribution. The areas considered as major contributors to microbial contamination were three of the sampled floors and the storage cabinet for tools, demonstrating to be important sources of possible cross-contamination. A total of four L. monocytogenes presences were obtained during sampling. Moreover, a direct relation was observed between aerobic counts and detecting L. monocytogenes , and three possible hypotheses were formulated to explain the connection. Last, a safety zone marking the limits beyond which the surface can be considered as a safety risk was established, although more studies are needed to demonstrate if these limits can be used as an internal hygienic surface control. The use of SCH sensors as a surface sampling system for the food industry have been shown to work effectively and with relative ease.},

Experiments were performed using distilled water as a hydrazine fuel simulant flowing through passageways simulating rocket engine injectors at the same Reynolds numbers and temperature conditions. Multiple orifice internal diameters and length-to-diameter ratios were evaluated with chamfered or sharp-edge orifice inlet geometries. Results showed that an increase in orifice diameter or decrease in length-to-diameter ratio led to decreased pressure drop across the injector. A sharp-edge orifice inlet geometry experienced cavitation under turbulent flow conditions at small length-to-diameter ratios and small orifice diameters, but was unaffected by cavitation at large orifice diameters for the same flow conditions. While a sharp-edge orifice inlet geometry was observed to have a greater pressure drop and longer jet breakup length for small orifices and length-to-diameter ratios, the chamfered orifice inlet geometry was not greatly influenced by length-to-diameter ratio at smaller orifices and had longer jet breakup lengths at higher orifices; meaning a larger percentage of liquid spray would reach an impingement point in a hypergolic liquid engine, increasing mixing and combustion.},

From the recorded X-band EPR spectra the spin-Hamiltonian parameters (SHP) were determined. The optical spectra of vanadium doped glass samples revealed a single absorption band at 596 nm which was assigned to 2 B 2g → 2 B 1g transition, whereas copper doped glasses revealed two absorption bands around 818 and 602 nm which were assigned to 2 B 1g → 2 B 2g and 2 B 1g → 2 E 2g transitions respectively. Theoretical studies were accomplished on the EPR and optical factors from perturbation theory. It was observed from both the experimental and theoretical SHP values of vanadium containing glasses that the VO 2+ ions are in tetragonally compressed octahedral sites with d xy ( 2 B 2g ) ground state, while the copper containing glasses found to be in tetragonally elongated octahedral sites with <mml:mspace width="0.25em"/> d x 2 − y 2 ( 2 B 1g ) as the ground state. It is found that the magnitude of the relative tetragonal compression ratio ( φ ) of vanadium ion is less than the relative tetragonal elongation ratio ( τ ) of copper ion. The nature of the bonding between TM ions (i.e. vanadium and copper) and their ligands was assessed. Theoretical and experimental EPR parameters are in great concurrence with each other.},

Specifically, we analyzed 1) evidence based on the internal structure of the eight basic interest scales, 2) convergent evidence of the PGI dimensions across different item types, and 3) evidence based on relations to plausible correlates of vocational interests, namely, gender, academic achievement, and the socioeconomic status associated with the desired profession. Moreover, we analyzed the extent to which these sources of evidence were invariant between the PGI and its associated short version – the PGI-S (Tracey, 2010). Relying on a sample of N = 688 university students in Germany, we were able to show that 1) the circular order of the basic interest scales was confirmed across item types and that it was invariant across PGI versions, 2) both the relationships between corresponding dimensions across item types as well as the relationships with the validity markers were, as far as the circumplex dimensions were concerned, in line with theoretical expectations and invariant across PGI versions, and 3) there were notable differences between the respective relationships with the Prestige dimensions across item types and PGI versions. We conclude by weighing up the pros and cons of the two PGI versions and suggesting specific situations in which the use of either version is advised.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Radiative heat transfer plays an important role in combustion systems. Good compromise between the accuracy and computational requirements of the weighted sum of gray gases (WSGG) model makes it widely used in CFD simulations. In this paper, the accuracy of various WSGG models is assessed by the comparison with the results of radiative heat source and heat flux calculated by line by line (LBL) approach in a realistic non-isothermal and non-homogeneous flame using decoupled calculations. Then these models are implemented to CFD code to investigate the radiative heat transfer for a 600 kW furnace using coupled calculations. The experimental data from the furnace has been used to evaluate the computational applicability and reliability of WSGG models. Results show that the non-gray formulation of WSGG model is more accurate than gray modelling approach, compared with LBL results. The non-gray WSGG models of Krishnamoorthy et al. (2013), Bordbar et al. (2014) and Shan et al. (2018) provide the minimal overall errors compared with the measured temperature fields. The results demonstrate that using the non-gray approach instead of gray approach for global CFD simulation improves the simulation accuracy of thermal radiation transfer. The computing time of non-gray models is larger, approximately 3–4 times that of gray WSGG models.},

Strong intermolecular attachment evolved between starch and pectin molecules due to hydrogen bonding of their hydrophilic groups, confirmed through scanning electron micrographs and FTIR spectra. Also, P-CF ratio (1:1) might retained some crystalline regions of starch which has significantly enhanced structural integrity and functionality of films in terms of tensile strength (TS), water solubility (WS), water vapour permeability (WVP) and thermal stability. In accordance with Herschel-Bulkley model, the predicted consistency index and flow behaviour values were affected by film formulation and the model was of good fit with R 2 = 0.81 (PC3), R 2 = 0.74 (PCB3) and R 2 = 0.99 (for rest formulations). Although, higher proportions of hydrophilic polymers (P, OPS \& BP) due to higher molecular mobility resulted in less rigid, highly soluble, moisture permeable and thermally unstable films. Furthermore, RF films possessed cracks over the surface and insoluble fractions due to insufficient starch gelatinization which decreased their TS and barrier properties. The ATR-FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of functional groups corresponding to starch and pectin in range of 500–4000 cm −1 . The variation among different films underlies only in peak intensities due to some molecular changes. Overall, the films made of P-CF ratio (1:1) were more functional and structurally stable as compared to rest of the films, thus, they would make a better alternative for synthetic packaging.},

This paper explores the challenges of financing this ‘retrofit’ activity. First, it develops a typology of finance mechanisms for residential retrofit highlighting their key design features, including: the source of capital ; the financial instrument(s) ; the project performance requirements; the point of sale ; the nature of the security and underwriting the repayment channel and customer journey . Combining information from interviews and documentary sources, the paper explores how these design features influence the success of the finance mechanisms in different contexts. First, it is shown that a low cost of capital for retrofit finance is critical to the economic viability of whole-house retrofits. Second, by funding non-energy measures such as general improvement works, finance mechanisms can enable broader sources of value that are more highly prized by households. Thirdly, mechanisms that reduce complexity by simplifying the customer journey are likely to achieve much higher levels of uptake. Most importantly we discuss how finance alone is unlikely to be a driver of demand for whole-house retrofit, and so instead should be viewed as a necessary component of a much broader retrofit strategy.},

Furthermore, to regenerate a bone defect in the CMF area, the used scaffold should have unique features such as different mechanical strength or physical property suitable for complex shape and function of the CMF bones. Therefore, a three-dimensional synthetic scaffold with a patient-customized structure and mechanical properties is more suitable for the regeneration. In this study, the customized kagome-structure scaffold with complex morphology was assessed in vivo. The customized 3D kagome-structure model for the defect region was designed according to data using 3D computed tomography. The kagome-structure scaffold and the conventional grid-structure scaffold (as a control group) were fabricated using a 3D printer with a precision extruding deposition head using poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). The two types of 3D printed scaffolds were implanted in the 8-shaped defect model on the rabbit calvarium. To evaluate the osteoconductivity of the implanted scaffolds, new bone formation, hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining were evaluated for 16 weeks after implantation of the scaffolds. To assess the mechanical robustness and stability of the kagome-structure scaffold, numerical analysis considering the ‘elastic-perfectly plastic’ material properties and deformation under self-contact condition was performed by finite element analysis. As a result, the kagome-structure scaffold fabricated using 3D printing technology showed excellent mechanical robustness and enhanced osteoconductivity than the control group. Therefore, the 3D printed kagome-structure scaffold can be a better option for bone regeneration in complex and large defects than the conventional grid-type 3D printed scaffold.},

The objective of this paper is to analyse the replacement of nuclear power plant with wind power plants to compare both cases from the viewpoints of power system reliability. The load diagram and the variability of the power plants, whose power depend on the environmental parameters with the time is considered. This paper is focused on the loss of load expectation. The upgraded method considers plant power as a function of the time instead of its nominal power. Initial real power system model consists of twelve power plants including one nuclear power plant. This plant is then replaced by three wind power plants with their total power five times larger than the power of the nuclear power plant. A comparison of reliability in terms of comparing the loss of load expectation is performed using the real weather data for one calendar year. The results show that the replacement of the nuclear power plant with several wind power plants with wind power capacity five times larger than the nuclear power capacity causes a decrease of the power system reliability.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Ganoderma lucidum ( G. lucidum ) spores oil, which was extracted from G. lucidum spores with supercritical fluid CO 2 , contains a lot of unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS). PUFAS in G. lucidum spores oil were oxidized easily, so it is important to protect G. lucidum spores oil and enhance its oxidation stability. In this paper, we investigated a way of protecting G. lucidum spores oil by microcapsulation with spray drying. Different combination types of wall materials were evaluated and the best choose was the gum Arabic (GA) and maltodextrin (MD) combination. Then, the effects of the emulsifying temperature, the wall materials concentration, and the ratio of oil to wall materials on the GA/MD microcapsules were investigated and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) was up to 83.57%. Gas chromatography was used to identify the components of fatty acids in original and GA/MD microcapsules. It showed that PUFAS were well retained and the content of it was up to 80.04%. Oxidation stability of G. lucidum spores oil was enhanced significantly. All results indicated that using GA and MD as composite wall materials could effectively protect for G. lucidum spores oil.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Many stock assessments heavily rely on indices of relative abundance derived from fisheries-dependent catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate different CPUE standardization methods under varying scenarios of data generating processes. Here, we evaluated nine CPUE standardization methods offering contrasting treatments of spatio-temporal variation, ranging from the basic generalized linear model (GLM) method not integrating a year-area interaction term to a sophisticated method using the spatio-temporal modeling platform VAST. We compared the performance of these methods against simulated data constructed to mimic the processes generating fisheries-dependent information for Atlantic blue marlin ( Makaira nigricans ), a common bycatch population in pelagic longline fisheries. Data were generated using a longline data simulator for different population trajectories (increasing, decreasing, and static). These data were further subsampled to mimic an observer program where trips rather than sets form the sampling frame, with or without a bias towards trips with low catch rates, which might occur if the presence of an observer alters fishing behavior to avoid bycatch. The spatio-temporal modeling platform VAST achieved the best performance in simulation, namely generally had one of the lowest biases, one of the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs), and 50% confidence interval coverage closest to 50%. Generalized additive models accounting for spatial autocorrelation at a broad spatial scale (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the lowest biases) and, to a lesser extent, non-spatial delta-lognormal GLMs including a year-area interaction as a random effect (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the best confidence interval coverages) also performed adequately. The VAST method provided the most comprehensive and consistent treatment of spatio-temporal variation, in contrast with methods that simply weight predictions by large spatial areas, where it is critical, but difficult, to get the a priori spatial stratification correct before weighting. Next, we applied the CPUE standardization methods to real data collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program. The indices of relative abundance predicted from real observer data were relatively similar across CPUE standardization methods for the period 1998–2017 and suggested that the blue marlin population of the Atlantic declined over the period 1998–2004 and was relatively stable afterwards. As spatio-temporal variation related to environmental changes or depletion becomes increasingly necessary to consider, greater use of spatio-temporal models for standardizing fisheries-dependent CPUE data will likely be warranted.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Regarding the importance of radioactive materials dispersion in the environment and their effect on living organism's well-being, this article examines the atmospheric dispersion of these materials around the Bushehr nuclear power plant (BNPP) in a hypothetical severe accident. One of practical dispersion models is AERMOD which is based on Gaussian distribution. This model which is an extension of Gaussian model is normally used for predicting the gaseous pollution. The aim of this study is to investigate the dispersion of radioactive materials in BNPP's surroundings due to a specific type of Large Break LOCA (LBLOCA) accident. In this study, the wind direction, wind speed, and the topological conditions of the power plant's environment are considered. In order to execute this model, the meteorology and topological data of the region have been provided. Besides, using the CONTAIN code, the data about released radioactive materials from the containment have been provided. The double ended cold leg break (DECL) accident in containment has been modeled and its validity has been checked with FSAR. Extracting all required data, the simulation is done in AERMOD and the volumetric concentration and activity of fission products are calculated. The volumetric activity of fission products in Tangestan, Bandar-E-Bushehr and Delvar cities are evaluated as 7.5658E+07, 7.5136E+07 and 2.9655E+06 (Bq/m 3 ), respectively. From results it could be seen that the most dispersion of the radioactive materials are in direction of the non-residential regions, although the pollution of the cities around the power plant is inevitable.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Collagen membranes have been widely applied for guided bone regeneration (GBR), a technique often utilized in dental implant surgery for bone argumentation. However, the implantation of collagen membranes also elicits foreign body reaction (FBR), the imbalance of which may lead to failures of dental implants. Macrophages play a pivotal role in FBR as macrophages can polarize into pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-regenerative (M2) phenotypes. Therefore, collagen membranes based on modulation of macrophage polarization have gained increased attention. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-modified collagen membranes have been previously shown to downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors. In the present study, scanning electron microscopy images showed that EGCG-modified collagen membranes prevented the migration of keratinocytes and maintained space for osteoblasts. CCK-8 and live/dead cell assays showed that EGCG-modified collagen membranes unaffected the cell viability of osteoblasts. In addition, immunofluorescent staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed an increased number of M2 macrophages, an upregulated expression of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and an upregulation of osteogenic differentiation-related factors including Runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteopontin after implantation of EGCG-modified collagen membranes. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Micro-CT further demonstrated that the application of EGCG-modified collagen membranes promoted new bone formation in vivo. From these findings it is concluded that EGCG-modified collagen membranes have promising potentials in GBR surgery which served as suitable barrier membranes and promoted bone regeneration in vivo by recruiting M2 macrophages, promoting secretion of growth factors and osteogenic differentiation.},
