	abstract = {Abstract(#br)This paper contributes to the literature that analyses the relationship between Share-Option Based Compensation (SOBC) expense and shareholder returns. It utilises a sample of financial firms listed in the European Economic Area and Switzerland between 2005 and 2016 to make inferences about the impact of the financial crisis on the above-mentioned relationship. The paper also assesses the extent to which the relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns during the financial crisis varies with ownership concentration. We find evidence that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns is significantly more apparent during the financial crisis. This suggests that investors place more emphasis on the unrecognised intangible features of SOBC contracts during the crisis, even though their associated expenses are subject to managerial discretion and measurement errors. We also find that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns over the financial crisis is more pronounced when ownership is more concentrated. The results of our study are robust after controlling for firm size, potential investment growth opportunities, traditional banking activities and firm self-selection bias.},

	abstract = {Abstract(#br)Scant information is available on the environmental impacts of baby food. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the life cycle environmental sustainability of one of the most common baby foods consumed for breakfast – ready-made porridge – and to identify options for improvements. Two variants of the product are considered: dry and wet porridge. The latter has from 43% to 23 times higher impacts than the dry alternative, with the global warming potential (GWP) of wet porridge being 2.6 times higher. However, the results are sensitive to the assumption on energy consumption for the manufacture of wet porridge, showing that reducing the amount of energy by 30% would reduce this difference by 5%–70% across the impacts. The main hotspots for both products are the raw materials and manufacturing; packaging is also significant for the wet option. For the dry porridge, product reformulation would reduce the environmental impacts by 1%–67%, including a 34% reduction in GWP. Reducing water content of the cereal mixture in dry porridge from 80% to 50% would reduce GWP of the manufacturing process by 65% and by 9% in the whole life cycle. Using a plastic pouch instead of a glass jar would decrease most environmental impacts of wet porridge by 7%–89%. The findings of this study will be of interest to both baby food producers and consumers.},
